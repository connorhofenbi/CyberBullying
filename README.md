# CyberBullying

<h3> Project Description </h3>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  Twitter data on cyberbullying was collected and recorded, including usernames, social connections, comments, etc. This data was then labeled as cyber bullying or not (one for cyber bullying or zero for not cyber bullying). The current goal of the project is to increase fairness in machine learning accuracies over stratas. For example if more data on introverts was collected than extroverts then the model would predict better for introverts. By increasing fairness I am trying to get the accuracies closer for every strata.
